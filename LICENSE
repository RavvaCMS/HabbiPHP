YOU MAY USE THIS AS BASE FOR A CMS, OR COPY THINGS FROM IT TO USE IT IN YOURS, BUT ONLY IF:

1) You'll give me, Aron (http://www.retronet.nl/User-aron) credits AND MENTION WHAT U USED
2) You'll place in the header 'Used parts of HabbiPHP - The never finished CMS Base'
3) Don't act like you're me and say: 'You don't have to put the licence shit into it'
4) Don't make money with anything I made

If you break ANY of this rules mentioned above, you'll get problems with Justice and shit
